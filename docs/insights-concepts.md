| **Data** | **The Narrative** |
| --- | --- |
| **High Video "Hook Rate" (45% vs 25% avg)** | "Your new founder video is a scroll-stopper. Nearly half the people who saw it watched the first 3 seconds. This is your new creative benchmark." |
| **Ad Spend on Out-of-Stock SKU ($150 this week)** | "You are paying to send traffic to a dead end. We detected $150 spent on the 'Blue Denim Jacket' which currently has 0 inventory." |
| **High Click-Through Rate (CTR) but High Bounce Rate** | "Clickbait Alert: Your ad is promising something your landing page isn't delivering. People are clicking, but leaving immediately." |
| **Google Brand Search Spike (+40%)** | "The 'Halo Effect' is active. Your Facebook push is driving people to Google you by name. Meta is creating the demand; Google is capturing it." |
| **CPA by State (CA: $85 vs. TX: $22)** | "California is an expensive date. It costs 4x more to acquire a customer there than in Texas. We recommend shifting budget South to lower blended costs." |
| **High "Add-to-Cart" Rate, Low Purchase Rate** | "Checkout Shock detected. Customers love the product but are bailing at shipping. Your shipping costs may be killing the deal." |
| **Frequency > 5.0 (Last 7 Days)** | "Stalker Alert: Your retargeting audience is exhausted. On average, they've seen your ad 5 times this week, and CTR has dropped by half." |
| **Google Search Terms: 'Cheap' / 'Free'** | "Leaky Budget: You spent $200 on queries including 'cheap' or 'free.' Since you are a premium brand, these are low-intent clicks we need to block." |
| **Mobile vs. Desktop Conversion Rate (1.2% vs 3.5%)** | "Your mobile experience is costing you money. 80% of traffic is mobile, but they convert at 1/3 the rate of desktop users." |
| **Age Demographic Flip (55+ has highest ROAS)** | "Surprise Audience: While your creative targets Gen Z, your most profitable customers are actually 55+. Consider testing imagery with older models." |
| **Google Shopping vs. Search Performance** | "PMax is doing the heavy lifting. Shopping ads are driving 90% of your sales, while standard Search keywords are mostly driving costly curiosity clicks." |
| **Meta "Audience Network" Placement** | "Junk Inventory: 20% of your budget went to the Audience Network (apps/games), which has a 95% bounce rate. We are turning this placement off." |
| **Day-of-Week ROAS (Tuesday High vs Saturday Low)** | "Your customers shop while at work. Tuesdays are highly profitable; Saturdays are dead zones. We will throttle weekend spend to save cash." |
| **Creative Format Win (UGC vs. Studio)** | "Lo-fi sells better. Your iPhone-shot user testimonials have a 50% lower Cost Per Acquisition than your polished studio photography." |
| **Ad Copy Winner ("BOGO" vs. "15% Off")** | "The psychology of 'Free' wins. The 'Buy One Get One' headline had a 20% higher click rate than '15% Off,' even though the math is similar." |
| **Google Impression Share Lost (Budget)** | "Leaving money on the table. You lost 40% of potential search impression share simply because the daily budget ran out by 2 PM." |
| **Meta "Quality Ranking" (Below Average)** | "The algorithm hates this ad. Meta has flagged your 'Summer Sale' creative as low quality, making your CPMs 30% more expensive than usual." |
| **High Spend on "Uncategorized" Traffic** | "The Ghost Traffic. A large portion of traffic is landing without UTM parameters, making it impossible to track. We need to fix your tracking templates." |
| **Specific Product ROAS < 1.0** | "Loss Leader or Loser? The 'Accessory Pack' costs more to advertise than the revenue it generates. Unless LTV is high, pause this product." |
| **Time Lag to Purchase (0 Days vs 7 Days)** | "Impulse Buyers. 85% of your sales happen within 24 hours of the first click. Long-window retargeting campaigns may be redundant." |
| **Gender Cost Disparity (Men $15 vs Women $45 CPA)** | "It is significantly cheaper to acquire male customers right now. Consider a 'Gifts for Her' angle to leverage this cheaper traffic source." |
| **YouTube View-Through Rate** | "Your intro is too slow. 60% of viewers skip before the 5-second mark. You need to put the product or hook in the very first frame." |
| **Google Auction Insights (Competitor Creep)** | "Amazon is bullying you. Amazon's impression share on your core keywords jumped from 10% to 50% this week, driving up your CPCs." |
| **High Social Engagement (Comments/Shares)** | "Viral Signal. This specific ad has 400 shares. It has become 'Social Proof' and is driving organic reach alongside the paid reach." |
| **Landing Page Load Time vs. Conversion** | "The need for speed. Ads pointing to the 'Collection Page' (4s load time) convert 50% worse than ads pointing to the 'Product Page' (1.5s load time)." |
| **Search Query: Competitor Names** | "Conquesting Win. You are successfully stealing traffic from searches for [Competitor Brand]. These clicks are converting at a high ROAS." |
| **Meta "ThruPlay" Cost** | "Expensive Eyeballs. You are paying $0.15 per video view, which is double the industry average. The content isn't resonating with this audience." |
| **High ROAS but Low Volume (Retargeting)** | "Harvesting, not Growing. Your ROAS looks great (10x), but 95% of spend is on Retargeting. You are squeezing current leads but not filling the top of the funnel." |
| **Google "Exact Match" vs "Broad Match"** | "Broad Match bleed. Broad match keywords are pulling in irrelevant queries. Switching to Exact Match for top terms could save 20% of budget." |
| **Lifetime Value (LTV) by Ad Channel** | "Google customers are worth more. Customers acquired via Google Search have a 30% higher Lifetime Value than those acquired via TikTok." |
| **Carousel Card Performance** | "The hidden winner. Users are swiping to the 3rd card in your Carousel to buy. We should move that 'Black Product Variant' to the first slot." |
| **Headline Testing: Question vs. Statement** | "Curiosity wins. The headline 'Is this the best wallet?' outperformed the statement 'The best wallet ever' by 15% in CTR." |
| **Influence Gap (Platform Claim vs. Shopify)** | "Reality Check. Facebook claims $10k in revenue, but Shopify only attributes $4k. The truth lies in the middle, but rely on cash-in-bank for budgeting." |
| **Ad Schedule (Midnight - 4 AM)** | "Insomniac Shoppers. Surprisingly, you have a high conversion rate between 2 AM and 4 AM. We should ensure bids aren't lowered during these hours." |
| **Rising CPM Trend (Week over Week)** | "Inflation Alert. The cost to reach 1,000 people has risen 25% this month due to seasonal competition. Efficiency will drop unless creatives improve." |
| **Google Ad Strength (Poor)** | "Google is penalizing you. Your 'Ad Strength' is Poor because you lack headlines. Adding 2 more headline variations could improve your rank." |
| **New Customer vs. Returning Customer Spend** | "Retention reliance. 60% of your 'Ad Revenue' this week came from people who have bought before. We need to push harder into cold audiences." |
| **Geo-Targeting (International)** | "Accidental Tourists. You received 50 clicks from the UK, but you don't ship there. We need to tighten location settings to 'People IN this location'." |
| **Video Sound On vs. Sound Off** | "Silent Movie failure. 80% of users watch with sound off, and your video lacks captions. You are communicating nothing to the majority of viewers." |
| **Product Feed "Disapproved" Status** | "Invisible Inventory. 15 of your top SKUs are disapproved in the Merchant Center due to missing GTINs. They are not showing up in Shopping ads." |
| **Device Bid Adjustments** | "Tablet Waste. Tablets have a $100 CPA compared to $40 on Desktop. We recommend a -100% bid adjustment to exclude tablets." |
| **Search Term Length (Long Tail)** | "Specifics sell. Search terms with 4+ words convert at 8%, while 1-2 word terms convert at 1%. Focusing on long-tail keywords is the efficiency play." |
| **Instagram Stories vs. Feed** | "Format Mismatch. You are running square 'Feed' images in the vertical 'Stories' placement. It looks unprofessional and CTR is suffering." |
| **Lead Form vs. Landing Page (Meta)** | "Friction check. On-Facebook Lead Forms are generating leads at $5, while driving to the website costs $15 per lead. The site is the bottleneck." |
| **Cost Per Unique Link Click** | "Click repetition. You are paying for the same people to click multiple times without buying. We need to exclude 'Link Clickers (Last 7 Days)'." |
| **Google Extension Interactions** | "Local Intent. 200 people clicked the 'Get Directions' map extension. Your ads are driving significant foot traffic to the physical store." |
| **Keyword Quality Score (1/10)** | "Relevance crisis. Your top keyword has a Quality Score of 1/10. Google is charging you a premium because your landing page doesn't match the keyword." |
| **Attribution Window Impact (1-day vs 7-day)** | "The slow burn. Only 20% of conversions happen 1-day post-click. If you optimize for 1-day click, you will kill campaigns that actually work over a week." |
| **Operating System (iOS vs Android)** | "The Apple Tax. Since iOS14, tracking Apple users is harder, making them look less profitable. Android users show a 2x better ROAS (likely a tracking artifact)." |
| **Total MER (Marketing Efficiency Ratio)** | "The Bottom Line. Despite platform volatility, your total ecosystem ROAS (MER) is 4.0. You are profitable on every dollar spent. Keep pushing." |
