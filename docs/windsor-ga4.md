# **Combining dimensions and metrics**

The Google Analytics 4 (GA4) API limits the amount of extracted metrics per source. You can extract up to **10 metrics and 9 dimensions per query**.

# **Custom dimensions and metrics**

Besides the list of fields presented below, users can request custom predefined dimensions and metrics.

It is worth noting that there are two types of fields: Dimensions and Metrics.

- **Dimensions** are summaries which contain ***text***, such as: account id, account name, campagin, etc.
- **Metrics** are values which return a ***numeric*** value, such as: clicks, conversions, spend, etc.

In order to retrieve the custom fields, you must provide **at least** one metric. For example, if you want to fetch ***date***, ***custom_dimension1***, you need to select one metric (i.e: ***sessions***). Moreover, if you want to fetch a metric, you **do not** need to have a dimension in the request which means that you can request ***date,custom_metric1*** directly.

To test if metrics and dimensions are compatible, you can use the Google Analytics explorer: https://ga-dev-tools.web.app/ga4/dimensions-metrics-explorer/
