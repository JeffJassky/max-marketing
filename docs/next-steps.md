# Gap Analysis & Next Steps: Maxed Marketing

## Executive Summary
The current system successfully establishes a "Single Truth" data pipeline for Google Ads, Meta Ads, GA4, and Shopify, with a robust reporting architecture. However, the "Dashboard" experience is largely improved by mock data, and several key platforms and cross-platform insights are missing.

To deliver true value to a Marketing Manager, we must move from "reporting stats" to "synthesizing strategy."

## 1. Platform Coverage Gaps

### 🔴 Critical Missing Data
*   **SEO / Local:** The UI references "Local SEO" (Reviews, GMB), but no data pipeline exists.
    *   *Action:* Integrate Google Search Console & Google Business Profile APIs.
*   **Email/SMS Marketing:** No visibility into retention channels (Klaviyo/Mailchimp).
    *   *Action:* Add Klaviyo Bronze Import (Campaigns & Flows).

### 🟡 Depth Gaps
*   **Meta Ads:** Current reporting is campaign-level summary.
    *   *Need:* Ad Set optimization (Audience saturation) and Creative-level analysis (Visual fatigue).
*   **Shopify:**
    *   *Need:* **Margin Analysis** (COGS support) to report on *Profit*, not just Revenue.
    *   *Need:* **Customer LTV** cohorts (New vs. Returning breakdown).

## 2. Feature Gaps: Dashboard Reality Check

The `DashboardView.vue` is currently a "Vision" prototype. Here is the path to making it real:

### ⚡ "Maxed Momentum" (Value Unlocked)
*   **Concept:** A running tally of estimated annual value generated by taking action on insights.
*   **Gap:** Currently hardcoded.
*   **Fix:**
    *   Add `estimated_value` field to every `AggregateReport` or `Monitor` anomaly.
    *   Create a `value_realized` log table to track when a user "Resolves" an item.
    *   Sum this log for the chart.

### 🎯 "Priority Focus" (The Feed)
*   **Concept:** A unified, ranked list of the ~3 most important actions across *all* platforms.
*   **Gap:** We have individual monitors, but no "Ranking Engine" to compare a Google Ads Keyword issue vs. a Shopify Inventory issue.
*   **Fix:**
    *   Implement a **Scoring Normalization** service.
    *   Assign specific `impact_score` (0-100) to every monitor output.
    *   Sort unified list by `impact_score` descending.

### 📊 "MER" (Marketing Efficiency Ratio)
*   **Concept:** `Total Revenue / Total Ad Spend`. The "North Star" for holistic growth.
*   **Gap:** Not calculated.
*   **Fix:**
    *   Create a new Aggregate Report: `global_marketing_efficiency`.
    *   Join `shopifyDaily.revenue` against `adsDaily.spend` (Google + Meta).

## 3. Proposed Roadmap

### Phase 1: The "Real" Dashboard (High Priority)
1.  **Global MER Metric:** Implement the calculation of Total Revenue / Total Spend.
2.  **Live Spend Breakdown:** Replace the hardcoded pie charts with the `adsSpendBreakdown` report data (already exists, just need to wire it up to the main dashboard component).
3.  **Unified Activity Feed:** Create a widget that pulls the top 5 anomalies from `/api/monitors/anomalies` and renders them as the "Priority Focus".

### Phase 2: Deeper Insights
1.  **Creative Gallery:** A visual view of Top Performing creatives across Meta & Google (using the thumbnail URLs we now have).
2.  **Profitability Mode:** Allow inputting a flat "Margin %" or COGS to see estimated Gross Profit.

### Phase 3: New Channels
1.  **Email (Klaviyo):** "Revenue per Recipient" tracking.
2.  **SEO:** Keyword ranking movements.
