### **Dashboard**

### **1. Holistic MER [Marketing Efficiency Ratio]**

- **Summary**: A "big picture" indicator of marketing efficiency across all channels, measuring how much total revenue is generated for every dollar spent on ads.
- **Formula & Source**:
  - **Formula**: $\text{Total Store Revenue} / \text{Total Ad Spend}$.
  - **Sources**: Shopify (Total Revenue) + [Meta Ads Spend + Google Ads Spend].
- **User Messaging (Rollover)**: "This is your 'Marketing Efficiency Ratio.' It shows your total store revenue relative to your total ad spend. A higher number means your marketing is working more efficiently to drive overall business growth."

### **2. Total Ad Spend**

- **Summary**: The aggregate amount of money spent on paid media across all connected advertising platforms for the selected period.
- **Formula & Source**:
  - **Formula**: $\sum(\text{Platform Spend})$.
  - **Sources**: Meta Ads API + Google Ads API.
- **User Messaging (Rollover)**: "The total amount you’ve invested in advertising across all platforms (like Meta and Google) during this timeframe."

### **3. Store Revenue**

- **Summary**: The total gross sales generated by the e-commerce store, regardless of the attribution source.
- **Formula & Source**:
  - **Formula**: $\sum(\text{Gross Sales})$.
  - **Source**: Shopify.
- **User Messaging (Rollover)**: "Your total gross sales recorded in Shopify. This includes all orders, whether they came from an ad, an email, or someone coming to your site directly."

### **4. Acquisition Health**

- **Summary**: Measures the percentage of revenue coming from new customers versus returning ones, indicating the brand's ability to scale.

**Developer Specification (Internal):**

- **Logic: Shopify classifies a customer as "Returning" only after their second order is marked as paid.**
- **Data Source: Shopify Admin API (GraphQL is preferred for performance).**
- **Endpoints: \* Primary: orders query.**
  1. **Specific Field: customer.ordersCount within each order node.**
- Backend Formula:
  1. **Fetch all orders within the date range where financial_status = paid.**
  2. **New Revenue: Sum of totalPriceSet where customer.ordersCount == 1.**
  3. **Returning Revenue: Sum of totalPriceSet where customer.ordersCount > 1.**
  4. **Final Calculation: (New Revenue / Total Revenue) \* 100.**
- Quality Control Note: If a customer places two orders in the _same_ day, Shopify's API may mark both as "Returning" if not handled correctly. Developers must ensure the _first_ order of the day for a brand-new customer is counted in the "New" bucket
- **User Messaging (Rollover)**: "This tracks your success in finding new customers. A high percentage means you are effectively growing your audience; a lower percentage means you are primarily relying on repeat buyers."

### **Row 2: Detailed Attribution & Mix**

### **5. True CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**

- **Summary**: The actual cost to acquire a single customer when comparing ad spend directly to new customer files, bypassing platform over-reporting.
- **Formula & Source**:
  - **Formula**: $\text{Total Ad Spend} / \text{New Customers Acquired}$.
  - **Sources**: [Meta + Google Spend] / Shopify (New Customer Count).
- **User Messaging (Rollover)**: "The 'Attribution Reality Check.' This is exactly what you paid in ads to get one new customer into your store, using your actual customer data rather than platform guesses."

### **6. Efficiency Gap**

- **Summary**: Compares the "Blended ROAS" (total business efficiency) against the average ROAS reported by individual platforms to show attribution overlap.
- **Formula & Source**:
  - **Formula**: $\text{Holistic MER} - \text{Platform Reported ROAS Average}$.
  - **Sources**: Maxed Marketing Calculation (MER) vs. Platform APIs (ROAS).
- **User Messaging (Rollover)**: "This highlights the difference between what platforms like Meta claim they are doing versus the actual profit you see in your bank account. It helps identify if platforms are 'over-claiming' credit for the same sale."

### **7. Marketing Mix (Visual/Chart Only)**

- **Summary**: A visual breakdown of how ad budget is distributed across different categories like Search vs. Social.
- **Formula & Source**:
  - **Formula**: $(\text{Channel Spend} / \text{Total Spend}) \times 100$.
  - **Sources**: Meta Ads API (Social) vs. Google Ads API (Search).

**User Messaging (Rollover)**

: "A bird's-eye view of where your money is going. This helps you ensure you aren't over-investing in one area (like Social) while neglecting another (like Search)."
